        npx create-react-app hello-world
* hello-world application will be created.
* Now open this hello-world folder in Visual Studio.
* Inside folder run:

        npm start

* we can add snippets in IDE, (For time being you can skip this)
* `rsf` snippet for stateless component
* `rcc` snippet for stateful component
* `con` snippet for constructor in stateful component
* `sst` snippet for state with in stateful component
* `ssf` snippet for state with function stateful component
